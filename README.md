# PROBLEM STATEMENT
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
While living or working in a college, it is extremely common for people to misplace some of their essential belongings. The current scenario is such that misplacing an object becomes a terrifying experience for the person because of the sheer size of the area that has to searched in order to find the lost item back. Moreover if someone has found an item and nobody is nearby to claim it then who will the item be returned to.

The only approach that a person in such a case resorts to is to send an e-mail on broadcast about the lost/found item. 

This approach is however not optimal, mainly because such random mails are not only a nuisance to majority of the people but also because of the fact that these mails are very hard to keep track off.

With the motivation of solving these problems elegantly and smoothly our group decided to launch a "Lost and Found" webpage for our college. Our web page will be able to take in both queries about a lost or found item and depending on the entries we will be able to return the lost item back to it's rightful owner. We aim to create a centralized platform via which all the interaction between the people who lose an item and their founders can be performed.
